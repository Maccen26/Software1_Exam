3. Create step-test file. Only 1 cucumber feature file per step file  

4. Write your 'Design by contract' for whitebox test if need a whitebox test


### Remarks: 
- We go for at least 90% code coverage. 
- If you choose not to test a method, you must document it such that we know its intentional 


## Writing code

### Steps: 

1. Mark at Trello the method you're implementing. \
    Remember to write you name on the method you're implementing such that we know whos responsible. 

2. Write test code first. 

3. Implement production code.  

4. If you create some helper functions for the BDD java step file, White box test them! You have to make sure the functions behave as anticipitated. 

### Remarks: 
Please follow these principles and have them in mind when creating the code
- Keep it simple and short (KISS) 
- You Aint Gonna Need It (YAGNI)
